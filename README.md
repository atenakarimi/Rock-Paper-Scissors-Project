# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project

This project is an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game with added sound effects. The game has been implemented using functions to ensure modularity and readability. It offers an exciting gaming experience, providing audio feedback based on the outcome of each round.

Features:
- The game prompts the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and provides colorful results for each round.
- The computer's choice is displayed to create an engaging user experience.
- Sound effects have been integrated into the game using the playsound library, enhancing the overall gameplay.
- After each round, the winner of that round is announced, and the appropriate sound effect is played (e.g., win song, lose song, or tie song).
- The game keeps track of the score and displays the current score after each round.
- At the end of the set, the final winner (user or computer) is announced, and a special "win game" or "lose game" sound is played accordingly.

To incorporate sound effects into the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the playsound library is used. This library enables seamless playback of sound files across different platforms. Before running the game, ensure that the playsound library is installed on your system by executing the following command:

pip install playsound

The colorful interface, dynamic audio feedback, and clear result announcements make this Rock-Paper-Scissors game both entertaining and enjoyable for players.
